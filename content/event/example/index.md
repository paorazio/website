summary: An integrated ABM approach to understanding the impact of pandemics and fiscal stimuli on the economy and climate
#abstract: 'The paper discusses how infectious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly impact public health, the economy, and society. It points out that while the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the link between climate change and human health and how global crises can unfold, there's a gap in existing research regarding the combined risks of climate change and pandemics.'

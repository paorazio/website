 abstract = {The dataset presented in this article contains the data gathered when surveying existing “green” macroprudential regulations and instruments. Official central banks’ documents and acts, as well as financial institutions reports, have been considered. In particular, for the selected OECD and non-OECD countries, the dataset contains information on the type of institutional governance, the mandate, the type of green regulation, the institution responsible for its implementation or promotion, the official reference and the related link to the document, as of February 2019. The dataset is made publicly available considering the actively evolving debate about the adoption of green prudential requirements and the implementation of green prudential instruments. © 2019},

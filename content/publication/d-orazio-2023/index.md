  aspects of green financial policymaking for 74 nations for the period 2000–2020
  by financial (central banks, financial regulators, supervisors) and non-financial
  (ministries, banking organizations, governments, and others) entities. The database
  is crucial for identifying and evaluating present and future trends in green financial
  policies, as well as the role played by central banks and regulators in raising
  green financing and taming financial instability caused by climate change. Data
  description: The database captures various aspects of financial (central banks and
  financial regulators and supervisors) and non-financial institutions' (ministries,

  adoption, measure adopted and its bindingness, and authority/ies responsible for
  its implementation The database includes 74 countries, of which 39 are advanced
  economies, 20 are emerging, and 15 are developing economies. Open knowledge and

 abstract = {Objectives: This article introduces the Climate-related Financial Policies Database and provides statistics on its main indicators. The database records many aspects of green financial policymaking for 74 nations for the period 2000–2020 by financial (central banks, financial regulators, supervisors) and non-financial (ministries, banking organizations, governments, and others) entities. The database is crucial for identifying and evaluating present and future trends in green financial policies, as well as the role played by central banks and regulators in raising green financing and taming financial instability caused by climate change. Data description: The database captures various aspects of financial (central banks and financial regulators and supervisors) and non-financial institutions' (ministries, banking associations, governments, and others) green financial policymaking in the period 2000–2020. Information is collected for the following variables: country/jurisdiction, economic development level (as defined by the World Bank Indicators), year of policy adoption, measure adopted and its bindingness, and authority/ies responsible for its implementation The database includes 74 countries, of which 39 are advanced economies, 20 are emerging, and 15 are developing economies. Open knowledge and data sharing encouraged by this article can support research in the developing field of financial policymaking related to climate change. © 2023, The Author(s).},

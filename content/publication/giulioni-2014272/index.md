abstract: "In this paper we present a new methodological approach based on the interplay
  between Experimental Economics and Agent-based Economics. Advances in the design
  and implementation of individual autonomous economic agents are presented. The methodology
  is organized in three steps. The first step focuses on agents. We use an inductive
  rather than a deductive approach: by means of the experimental method we observe
  agents' behaviors. The second step is the behavioral rules' building process that
  allows us to study how to estimate and structure artificial agents. In the third
  step, the set of previously induced behavioral rules are used to build artificial
  agents, i.e. \\\"molded\\\" avatars, which operate in the \\\"archetype\\\" macroeconomic
  system. The resulting Multi-agent system serves as the macroeconomic environment
  for our simulations and economic policy analysis. Copyright Â© 2014 SCITEPRESS."

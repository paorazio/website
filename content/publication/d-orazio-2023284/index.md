abstract: The proposed analysis investigates whether the type of central banks’ monetary
  policy mandates and their financial stability governance arrangements influence
  the adoption of climate-related financial policies. The empirical findings confirm
  a statistically significant relationship between a broader monetary policy mandate
  and the adoption of climate-related financial policies. However, the hypothesis
  – informed by existing literature – that a more integrated financial stability governance
  model would imply a higher adoption of climate-related financial policies is not
  confirmed. Focusing on G20 countries in 2000–2018, the study reveals that a more
  complex financial stability governance based on less integrated arrangements is
  more successful for climate-related financial policy adoption. Other factors, such
  as the presence of a democratic regime, the independence of the central bank, and
  being a member of the Sustainable Banking Network, have a positive and (statistically)
  significant effect across all specifications. Moreover, the materialization of climate-related
  physical risks such as, e.g., floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms, and transition
  risks proxied by – among others – CO2 emissions per capita, climate mitigation policies,
  and financial readiness to implement climate adaptation plans are also essential.
  The results are robust after considering a different dependent variable and several
  alternative model specifications. © 2023 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et

abstract: The paper presents an agent-based model to study the interaction between
  income inequality and prudential regulations in a macroeconomic framework characterized
  by consumer debt. Simulation results show that income inequality is detrimental
  to both macro and financial stability as it leads to higher credit demands, higher
  unemployment rates, economic volatility, and financial fragility. Besides the importance
  of consumers' leveraging, deleveraging externalities are found to be equally important
  for the emergence of crises and financial fragility because of the liquidity risk
  they entail. Minsky moments are also observed; they are related to consumers' prudential
  behavior and their beliefs about the macroeconomic conditions. Concerning the policy
  relevance of our investigation, simulations allow us to highlight that the effectiveness
  of prudential regulation depends on the phase of the business cycle and that there
  is not a “one-size-fits-all” regulation. This study emphasizes that regulatory constraints
  should take into account the features of the economic agents, such as the distribution
  of income and their willingness to borrow, in addition to the features of the financial
  sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

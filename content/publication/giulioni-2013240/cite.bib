 abstract = {In this paper, we present a web-based software model in which the user manages a virtual enterprise. By using the software, the user experiences a number of basic economic principles such as the financial leverage, the effect of depreciation and the key role of the equity base in a framework characterised by risk and uncertainty. The software was initially used in an undergraduate class. Students recognised the usefulness of this tool in experiencing the theoretical principles learned during lectures. We then asked different subject pools, i.e. high school students and entrepreneurs, to manage the same graphical user interface. A comparative analysis of the results obtained in the three pools demonstrates that our software is an effective learning tool. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

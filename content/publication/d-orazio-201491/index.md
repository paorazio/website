abstract: The present paper suggests the development of an experimentally microfounded
  Agent-based model in order to cope with the complexity and instability of the macroeconomic
  environment. The focus of the paper is on the microspecification of the ABM. For
  the micro level, I suggest to design an experiment in order to gain insights into
  households' behaviors. For the macro level, I plan to build an ABM where agents
  are estimated, rather than calibrated, by using data collected in the experimental
  laboratory. Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

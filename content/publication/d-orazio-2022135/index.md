abstract: Although the awareness about the climate-related financial risks and the
  need to scale up green finance is widespread globally, engagement in “active” climate-related
  financial policymaking varies across countries. Despite the progress in understanding
  the types of policies available at the country level, our knowledge of which factors
  influence the decision to adopt climate-related financial policies remains limited.
  This paper proposes an empirical analysis of the climate-related financial policy
  experiences of G20 countries as they are responsible for roughly 80 percent of global
  energy use and CO2 emissions. The cluster analysis considering the period from 2000
  to 2018 shows some interesting results. First, the economy's carbon intensity and
  exposure to climate change matter, but the policy response to these factors is heterogeneous
  across clusters. Second, climate strategies and fiscal instruments are relevant
  only for first-wave adopters in high-income countries. Third, political characteristics,
  particularly the presence of an autocratic regime, are relevant for the Chinese
  case, calling to mind the “authoritarian environmentalism”. Fourth, the bandwagon,
  or geographical learning effect, plays a relevant role in all clusters. © 2021 CEPII

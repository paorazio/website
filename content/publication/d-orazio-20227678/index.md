abstract: This paper studies the effects of financial development, economic growth,
  and climate-related financial policies on carbon emissions for G20 countries. The
  focus is particularly on financial policies implemented to scale up green finance
  and address climate-related financial risks from 2000 to 2017 and represent this
  paper’s value added. The empirical results obtained by relying on the panel quantile
  regression approach indicate that the impacts of the different explanatory variables
  on carbon emission are heterogeneous. Specifically, the effect of the stock of short-term
  financial policies on carbon emissions is negative, and its effect becomes smaller
  at higher quantiles. The stock of long-term policies also shows significant negative
  coefficients, but its impact is stronger for higher quantiles. No significance is
  reported for the lowest quantile. Financial development contributes to improving
  environmental quality, and its impact is larger in higher emission countries. Energy
  consumption increases carbon emissions, with the strongest effects occurring at
  higher quantiles. Our results also support the validity of the EKC relationship
  and positive effects of GDP and population on high carbon emissions levels. Estimation
  results are robust to alternative model specifications and after controlling for
  the role played by adopting international climate change mitigation policies as
  proxied by the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. © 2021, The Author(s).

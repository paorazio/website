abstract: Although renewable energy investments are not characterized by climate change
  mitigation as their primary objective, they still target activities that are related
  to the reduction of GHG emissions and are thus crucial for the transition to a low-carbon
  economy. The paper offers an analysis of the peculiarity of the German public finance
  framework aimed at renewable energy financing. On the one hand, it quantifies the
  amount of public financial capital, and types of financial instruments, devoted
  to renewable energy starting from 2010. On the other hand, it finds a strong relationship
  between public funding and the mobilization of private renewable energy investments.
  Our results point out that, despite the rapid growth of renewable energy investments
  in the past decades and the progressive reduction of GHG emissions, the country
  is facing difficulties in meeting the desired targets. © 2020 Informa UK Limited,

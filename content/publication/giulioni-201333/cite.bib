 abstract = {In this paper we present an interactive web-based application which could allow to explore entrepreneurial management. The main topic of the investigation is the analysis of entrepreneurship as a judgmental decision making under uncertainty. At this stage we outline the theoretical background which is behind the software and its basic functioning. We maintain that the fundamental research, which underpins our model, could stimulate new way of thinking to the development of a knowledgedriven tool in supporting risk-taking propensity. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract: In this paper we present an interactive web-based application which could
  allow to explore entrepreneurial management. The main topic of the investigation
  is the analysis of entrepreneurship as a judgmental decision making under uncertainty.
  At this stage we outline the theoretical background which is behind the software
  and its basic functioning. We maintain that the fundamental research, which underpins
  our model, could stimulate new way of thinking to the development of a knowledgedriven
  tool in supporting risk-taking propensity. Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland

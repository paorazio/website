abstract: In this paper we discuss recent trends on the interplay between Experimental
  Economics and Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). Experimental Economics
  proved useful in providing insights on human subjects' decision-making as well as
  microeconomic data to estimate artificial agents. Agent-based Computations Economics
  allows for observing the aggregate outcome of artificial agents' interactions and
  for replicating experiments at a larger scale. Â© Springer International Publishing

 abstract = {In this paper we discuss recent trends on the interplay between Experimental Economics and Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). Experimental Economics proved useful in providing insights on human subjects' decision-making as well as microeconomic data to estimate artificial agents. Agent-based Computations Economics allows for observing the aggregate outcome of artificial agents' interactions and for replicating experiments at a larger scale. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

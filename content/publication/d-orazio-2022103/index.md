abstract: This paper discusses how financial stability governance has evolved and
  how central banks and financial regulators are coping with the threats posed by
  climate uncertainty, providing an overview of G20 countries’ green central banking
  experiences in the past 20 years. The analysis shows that most central banks realise
  their climate ambitions through financial stability mandates, leaving the monetary
  stability mandate unaffected. Considering the debate on market neutrality, the concerns
  on the risk of overstretching the central banks’ mandate, violation of Tinbergen’s
  principle and threats posed to central banks’ independence, the provided evidence
  reveals a mismatch between the observed policy practice and its theoretical underpinnings.
  Drawing on these findings, we argue that effective green central banking governance
  should be based on a synthesis between monetary and macroprudential policymaking.

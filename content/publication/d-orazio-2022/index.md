abstract: This study presents a composite index for assessing, quantifying, and comparing
  international engagement based on evidence that countries have been globally committed
  – to varying degrees – to climate-related financial policymaking in recent decades.
  The proposed investigation aims to promote awareness about countries’ global engagement
  and identify gaps in climate-related financial policy. Using a standardised metric,
  researchers and policymakers can use the generated climate-related financial policy
  index (CRFPI) to compare international commitment to climate-related financial policymaking.
  Emerging economies are the most engaged in green financial policymaking, although
  they report the highest within-group variability, indicating no standard or general
  approach to “greening” the financial system. The index demonstrates a location effect,
  as most jurisdictions with high CRFPIs are in Asia-Pacific and North Europe. Brazil,
  China, France, Indonesia, and South Korea had the highest scores among G20 countries.
  After examining several aggregation approaches, the findings appear to be robust
  overall. © 2022 The Author(s)

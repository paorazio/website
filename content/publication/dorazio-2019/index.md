abstract: While there is a growing debate among researchers and practitioners on the
  possible role of central banks and financial regulators in supporting a smooth transition
  to a low-carbon economy, the information on which macroprudential instruments could
  be used for reaching the “green structural change” is still quite limited. Moreover,
  the achievement of climate goals is still affected by the so-called “green finance
  gap”. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a critical review of existing
  and novel prudential approaches to incentivizing the decarbonization of banks' balance
  sheets and aligning finance with sustainable growth and development objectives.
  The analysis carried out in the paper allows understanding of under which conditions
  macroprudential policy could tackle climate change and promote green lending, while
  also containing climate-related financial risks.

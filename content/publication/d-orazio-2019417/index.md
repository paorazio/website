abstract: The implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation policies depend
  on the development of green technologies whose diffusion is constrained by a number
  of barriers which prevent them to spread broadly and at a fast pace. By means of
  an agent-based computational model, the paper investigates the macro and micro economic
  dynamics considering the role of a “traditional” commercial bank and a state investment
  bank that explicitly supports green investments. Simulation results emphasize that
  green finance matter and that the market diffusion of environmental innovation is
  more pronounced when the presence of the public investment bank is combined with
  strong consumers’ preferences oriented towards environmental quality. The relevance
  of the paper is twofold. Besides contributing to the literature on the finance-innovation
  nexus by considering the role of climate finance within a complex systems framework,
  it provides a model that can be used as a tool to explore policies to foster environmental
  innovation diffusion. © 2018

 abstract = {The modern financial system has enabled a globalized economy by leveraging investments for production, consumption, and the trade of goods and services. However, this system has also engendered a series of wicked problems and externalities, including but not limited to climate change, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, and inequalities that significantly challenge the well-being of nature and people. The system is also currently inadequate with regards to financing sustainable development, as recognized by the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This Voices asks: what must be done to transform today's financial system for a sustainable future? © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract: "The modern financial system has enabled a globalized economy by leveraging
  investments for production, consumption, and the trade of goods and services. However,
  this system has also engendered a series of wicked problems and externalities, including
  but not limited to climate change, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, and
  inequalities that significantly challenge the well-being of nature and people. The
  system is also currently inadequate with regards to financing sustainable development,
  as recognized by the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This Voices asks: what must
  be done to transform today's financial system for a sustainable future? © 2023 Elsevier

	abstract = {Objectives: This article introduces the Climate-related Financial Policies Database and provides statistics on its main indicators. The database records many aspects of green financial policymaking for 74 nations for the period 2000–2020 by financial (central banks, financial regulators, supervisors) and non-financial (ministries, banking organizations, governments, and others) entities. The database is crucial for identifying and evaluating present and future trends in green financial policies, as well as the role played by central banks and regulators in raising green financing and taming financial instability caused by climate change. Data description: The database captures various aspects of financial (central banks and financial regulators and supervisors) and non-financial institutions' (ministries, banking associations, governments, and others) green financial policymaking in the period 2000–2020. Information is collected for the following variables: country/jurisdiction, economic development level (as defined by the World Bank Indicators), year of policy adoption, measure adopted and its bindingness, and authority/ies responsible for its implementation The database includes 74 countries, of which 39 are advanced economies, 20 are emerging, and 15 are developing economies. Open knowledge and data sharing encouraged by this article can support research in the developing field of financial policymaking related to climate change. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The proposed analysis investigates whether the type of central banks’ monetary policy mandates and their financial stability governance arrangements influence the adoption of climate-related financial policies. The empirical findings confirm a statistically significant relationship between a broader monetary policy mandate and the adoption of climate-related financial policies. However, the hypothesis – informed by existing literature – that a more integrated financial stability governance model would imply a higher adoption of climate-related financial policies is not confirmed. Focusing on G20 countries in 2000–2018, the study reveals that a more complex financial stability governance based on less integrated arrangements is more successful for climate-related financial policy adoption. Other factors, such as the presence of a democratic regime, the independence of the central bank, and being a member of the Sustainable Banking Network, have a positive and (statistically) significant effect across all specifications. Moreover, the materialization of climate-related physical risks such as, e.g., floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms, and transition risks proxied by – among others – CO2 emissions per capita, climate mitigation policies, and financial readiness to implement climate adaptation plans are also essential. The results are robust after considering a different dependent variable and several alternative model specifications. © 2023 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy},

The focus is particularly on financial policies implemented to scale up green finance and address climate-related financial risks from 2000 to 2017 and represent this paper’s value added. The empirical results obtained by relying on the panel quantile regression approach indicate that the impacts of the different explanatory variables on carbon emission are heterogeneous. Specifically, the effect of the stock of short-term financial policies on carbon emissions is negative, and its effect becomes smaller at higher quantiles. The stock of long-term policies also shows significant negative coefficients, but its impact is stronger for higher quantiles. No significance is reported for the lowest quantile. Financial development contributes to improving environmental quality, and its impact is larger in higher emission countries. Energy consumption increases carbon emissions, with the strongest effects occurring at higher quantiles. Our results also support the validity of the EKC relationship and positive effects of GDP and population on high carbon emissions levels. Estimation results are robust to alternative model specifications and after controlling for the role played by adopting international climate change mitigation policies as proxied by the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study presents a composite index for assessing, quantifying, and comparing international engagement based on evidence that countries have been globally committed – to varying degrees – to climate-related financial policymaking in recent decades. The proposed investigation aims to promote awareness about countries’ global engagement and identify gaps in climate-related financial policy. Using a standardised metric, researchers and policymakers can use the generated climate-related financial policy index (CRFPI) to compare international commitment to climate-related financial policymaking. Emerging economies are the most engaged in green financial policymaking, although they report the highest within-group variability, indicating no standard or general approach to “greening” the financial system. The index demonstrates a location effect, as most jurisdictions with high CRFPIs are in Asia-Pacific and North Europe. Brazil, China, France, Indonesia, and South Korea had the highest scores among G20 countries. After examining several aggregation approaches, the findings appear to be robust overall. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {All G20 countries have adopted policies to tame financial instability in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-pandemic financial measures are designed to support bank lending, boost financial markets’ liquidity, reduce banks’ funding liquidity costs, and allow for a smoother transition in monetary and fiscal policies. However, when analyzed in a broader framework that considers possible interlinkages between the pandemic and threats posed by climate change, these measures are not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Indeed, there is no evidence that recovery policies to date reflect sustainability priorities nor do they account for climate-related financial risks. The analysis carried out suggests that this failure to account for climate change could amplify the build-up of additional climate-related financial risks and of existing vulnerabilities in the financial system, leading to increased overall exposure to climate risks and thus undermining the low-carbon transition in G20 countries. Against this backdrop, the paper reviews several financial measures to avoid increasing the high carbon bias of existing policies and to explicitly address climate-related risks in the financial sector. The author proposes an enhanced macro-prudential policy framework to achieve three interrelated objectives: tackle climate-related financial risks, scale up green finance for a greener and more sustainable recovery, and preserve the global financial system’s resilience. Key policy insights: A macro-prudential strategy aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement is needed to address carbon bias, avoid the increase of climate-related financial risks, and reorient financial flows towards sustainable investments. ‘Green-enhanced’ capital requirements can be used, but they need careful calibration to prevent financial instabilities, while green liquidity instruments pose fewer implementation concerns. Climate-related large exposure limits could help contain systemic risks deriving from the materialization of climate risks. Harmonized taxonomy and enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements are critical for the correct functioning of proposed climate-related financial instruments. Implementing such instruments in a post-pandemic financial policy framework could help underpin a transformative financial response to climate change while strengthening the resilience of the global financial system. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Considering the debate on market neutrality, the concerns on the risk of overstretching the central banks’ mandate, violation of Tinbergen’s principle and threats posed to central banks’ independence, the provided evidence reveals a mismatch between the observed policy practice and its theoretical underpinnings.

Despite the progress in understanding the types of policies available at the country level, our knowledge of which factors influence the decision to adopt climate-related financial policies remains limited. This paper proposes an empirical analysis of the climate-related financial policy experiences of G20 countries as they are responsible for roughly 80 percent of global energy use and CO2 emissions. The cluster analysis considering the period from 2000 to 2018 shows some interesting results. First, the economy's carbon intensity and exposure to climate change matter, but the policy response to these factors is heterogeneous across clusters. Second, climate strategies and fiscal instruments are relevant only for first-wave adopters in high-income countries. Third, political characteristics, particularly the presence of an autocratic regime, are relevant for the Chinese case, calling to mind the “authoritarian environmentalism”.

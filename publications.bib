abstract = {The proposed analysis investigates whether the type of central banks' monetary policy mandates and their financial stability governance arrangements influence the adoption of climate-related financial policies. The empirical findings confirm a statistically significant relationship between a broader monetary policy mandate and the adoption of climate-related financial policies. However, the hypothesis – informed by existing literature – that a more integrated financial stability governance model would imply a higher adoption of climate-related financial policies is not confirmed. Focusing on G20 countries in 2000–2018, the study reveals that a more complex financial stability governance based on less integrated arrangements is more successful for climate-related financial policy adoption. Other factors, such as the presence of a democratic regime, the independence of the central bank, and being a member of the Sustainable Banking Network, have a positive and (statistically) significant effect across all specifications. Moreover, the materialization of climate-related physical risks such as, e.g., floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms, and transition risks proxied by – among others – CO2 emissions per capita, climate mitigation policies, and financial readiness to implement climate adaptation plans are also essential. The results are robust after considering a different dependent variable and several alternative model specifications.}

abstract = "The implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation policies depend on the development of green technologies whose diffusion is constrained by a number of barriers which prevent them to spread broadly and at a fast pace. By means of an agent-based computational model, the paper investigates the macro and micro economic dynamics considering the role of a “traditional” commercial bank and a state investment bank that explicitly supports green investments. Simulation results emphasize that green finance matter and that the market diffusion of environmental innovation is more pronounced when the presence of the public investment bank is combined with strong consumers’ preferences oriented towards environmental quality. The relevance of the paper is twofold. Besides contributing to the literature on the finance-innovation nexus by considering the role of climate finance within a complex systems framework, it provides a model that can be used as a tool to explore policies to foster environmental innovation diffusion."

abstract = "While there is a growing debate among researchers and practitioners on the possible role of central banks and financial regulators in supporting a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy, the information on which macroprudential instruments could be used for reaching the “green structural change” is still quite limited. Moreover, the achievement of climate goals is still affected by the so-called “green finance gap”. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a critical review of existing and novel prudential approaches to incentivizing the decarbonization of banks' balance sheets and aligning finance with sustainable growth and development objectives. The analysis carried out in the paper allows understanding of under which conditions macroprudential policy could tackle climate change and promote green lending, while also containing climate-related financial risks."

The dataset is made publicly available considering the actively evolving debate about the adoption of green prudential requirements and the implementation of green prudential instruments."
